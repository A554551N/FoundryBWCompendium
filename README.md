# FoundryBWCompendium

This repository contains materials for use with [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/). Please ensure that you know what you're doing when you're editing files on your server. I only half know what I'm doing half the time, so make sure to double-check everything.

## Introduction

This is a set of Compendiums for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that are compatible with [StasTserk Burning Wheel Module](https://github.com/StasTserk/foundry-burningwheel), for the [Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/burning-wheel/) tabletop RPG. I am not associated with either StasTserk or the BWHQ, and this is an independent work based off some files shared in the [Burning Wheel Discord](https://discord.gg/kdcjAgS).

## Installation

I haven't figured out yet how to properly install these, so the current method is to do so manually. I recommend the following procedure:

1. Make a the following empty compendiums in your Burning Wheel FoundryVTT world:
    - Common Skills
    - Common Traits
    - Dwarven Lifepaths
    - Dwarven Traits
    - Elven Lifepaths
    - Elven Traits
    - Human Lifepaths
    - Melee Weapons
    - Orcish Lifepaths
    - Orc Traits
    - Ranged Weapons
2. Navigate to your Foundry install packs subfolder. For example: /home/foundry/foundrydata/Data/worlds/YourWorldHere/packs
3. Replace the \*.db files there with the ones from this GitHub
4. Fully restart your server; i.e. reloading your world is not enough, you must reboot your Foundry server.

## Current Status

- Information from the Codex is not fully implemented.
- Spells are not included.
